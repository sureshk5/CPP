//What is a class? Its an User defined type that can hold a composition
//of multiple data types into a single unit that could represent
// a real world entity. Entity means a real world representation of
//an alive person or a feature.
//When a class is created and used, U get a host of features of the OOP like
//Encapsulation which is also called as Data Hiding. It means that variables of the
//class(Fields or members) created are private to the class. It means that it is not
//accessible outside the class declaration.
//To make it accessible it should be defined under public accessor.
//POINT: Fields of a class are usually expected to be private.
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
//Use Pascal casing for defining UR Classname, it means that the first letter of the
//word should be in upper case. If there are 2 or more words combined, then the first
//letter of every word should be in upper case.
class Student{
	//data inside this class that represents real time data of each student....
//for private members, it should be camel casing....

		studentId = id;
		//Always the parameters which are local to the function will have
		//high precedence over the class level variables with the same name. So to
		//refer the members, U should use this operator which internally refers as 
		//reference of the object thro which we could access the members using -> operator.
